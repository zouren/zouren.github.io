        <p>Your Royal Highness, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I have chosen this subject for my lecture tonight because I think that most current discussions of politics and political theory take insufficient account of psychology. Economic facts, population statistics, constitutional organization, and so on, are set forth minutely. There is no difficulty in finding out how many South Koreans and how many North Koreans there were when the Korean War began. If you will look into the right books you will be able to ascertain what was their average income per head, and what were the sizes of their respective armies. But if you want to know what sort of person a Korean is, and whether there is any appreciable difference between a North Korean and a South Korean; if you wish to know what they respectively want out of life, what are their discontents, what their hopes and what their fears; in a word, what it is that, as they say, ?makes them tick?, you will look through the reference books in vain. And so you cannot tell whether the South Koreans are enthusiastic about UNO, or would prefer union with their cousins in the North. Nor can you guess whether they are willing to forgo land reform for the privilege of voting for some politician they have never heard of. It is neglect of such questions by the eminent men who sit in remote capitals, that so frequently causes disappointment. If politics is to become scientific, and if the event is not to be constantly surprising, it is imperative that our political thinking should penetrate more deeply into the springs of human action. What is the influence of hunger upon slogans? How does their effectiveness fluctuate with the number of calories in your diet? If one man offers you democracy and another offers you a bag of grain, at what stage of starvation will you prefer the grain to the vote? Such questions are far too little considered. However, let us, for the present, forget the Koreans, and consider the human race.</p>
<p>All human activity is prompted by desire. There is a wholly fallacious theory advanced by some earnest moralists to the effect that it is possible to resist desire in the interests of duty and moral principle. I say this is fallacious, not because no man ever acts from a sense of duty, but because duty has no hold on him unless he desires to be dutiful. If you wish to know what men will do, you must know not only, or principally, their material circumstances, but rather the whole system of their desires with their relative strengths.</p>
<p>There are some desires which, though very powerful, have not, as a rule, any great political importance. Most men at some period of their lives desire to marry, but as a rule they can satisfy this desire without having to take any political action. There are, of course, exceptions; the rape of the Sabine women is a case in point. And the development of northern Australia is seriously impeded by the fact that the vigorous young men who ought to do the work dislike being wholly deprived of female society. But such cases are unusual, and in general the interest that men and women take in each other has little influence upon politics.</p>
<p>The desires that are politically important may be divided into a primary and a secondary group. In the primary group come the necessities of life: food and shelter and clothing. When these things become very scarce, there is no limit to the efforts that men will make, or to the violence that they will display, in the hope of securing them. It is said by students of the earliest history that, on four separate occasions, drought in Arabia caused the population of that country to overflow into surrounding regions, with immense effects, political, cultural, and religious. The last of these four occasions was the rise of Islam. The gradual spread of Germanic tribes from southern Russia to England, and thence to San Francisco, had similar motives. Undoubtedly the desire for food has been, and still is, one of the main causes of great political events.</p>
<p>But man differs from other animals in one very important respect, and that is that he has some desires which are, so to speak, infinite, which can never be fully gratified, and which would keep him restless even in Paradise. The boa constrictor, when he has had an adequate meal, goes to sleep, and does not wake until he needs another meal. Human beings, for the most part, are not like this. When the Arabs, who had been used to living sparingly on a few dates, acquired the riches of the Eastern Roman Empire, and dwelt in palaces of almost unbelievable luxury, they did not, on that account, become inactive. Hunger could no longer be a motive, for Greek slaves supplied them with exquisite viands at the slightest nod. But other desires kept them active: four in particular, which we can label acquisitiveness, rivalry, vanity, and love of power.</p>
<p>Acquisitiveness - the wish to possess as much as possible of goods, or the title to goods - is a motive which, I suppose, has its origin in a combination of fear with the desire for necessaries. I once befriended two little girls from Estonia, who had narrowly escaped death from starvation in a famine. They lived in my family, and of course had plenty to eat. But they spent all their leisure visiting neighbouring farms and stealing potatoes, which they hoarded. Rockefeller, who in his infancy had experienced great poverty, spent his adult life in a similar manner. Similarly the Arab chieftains on their silken Byzantine divans could not forget the desert, and hoarded riches far beyond any possible physical need. But whatever may be the psychoanalysis of acquisitiveness, no one can deny that it is one of the great motives - especially among the more powerful, for, as I said before, it is one of the infinite motives. However much you may acquire, you will always wish to acquire more; satiety is a dream which will always elude you.</p>
<p>But acquisitiveness, although it is the mainspring of the capitalist system, is by no means the most powerful of the motives that survive the conquest of hunger. Rivalry is a much stronger motive. Over and over again in Mohammedan history, dynasties have come to grief because the sons of a sultan by different mothers could not agree, and in the resulting civil war universal ruin resulted. The same sort of thing happens in modern Europe. When the British Government very unwisely allowed the Kaiser to be present at a naval review at Spithead, the thought which arose in his mind was not the one which we had intended. What he thought was, ?I must have a Navy as good as Grandmamma’s?. And from this thought have sprung all our subsequent troubles. The world would be a happier place than it is if acquisitiveness were always stronger than rivalry. But in fact, a great many men will cheerfully face impoverishment if they can thereby secure complete ruin for their rivals. Hence the present level of taxation.</p>
<p>Vanity is a motive of immense potency. Anyone who has much to do with children knows how they are constantly performing some antic, and saying ?Look at me?. ?Look at me? is one of the most fundamental desires of the human heart. It can take innumerable forms, from buffoonery to the pursuit of posthumous fame. There was a Renaissance Italian princeling who was asked by the priest on his deathbed if he had anything to repent of. ?Yes?, he said, ?there is one thing. On one occasion I had a visit from the Emperor and the Pope simultaneously. I took them to the top of my tower to see the view, and I neglected the opportunity to throw them both down, which would have given me immortal fame?. History does not relate whether the priest gave him absolution. One of the troubles about vanity is that it grows with what it feeds on. The more you are talked about, the more you will wish to be talked about. The condemned murderer who is allowed to see the account of his trial in the press is indignant if he finds a newspaper which has reported it inadequately. And the more he finds about himself in other newspapers, the more indignant he will be with the one whose reports are meagre. Politicians and literary men are in the same case. And the more famous they become, the more difficult the press-cutting agency finds it to satisfy them. It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the influence of vanity throughout the range of human life, from the child of three to the potentate at whose frown the world trembles. Mankind have even committed the impiety of attributing similar desires to the Deity, whom they imagine avid for continual praise.</p>
<p>But great as is the influence of the motives we have been considering, there is one which outweighs them all. I mean the love of  power. Love of power is closely akin to vanity, but it is not by any means the same thing. What vanity needs for its satisfaction is glory, and it is easy to have glory without power. The people who enjoy the greatest glory in the United States are film stars, but they can be put in their place by the Committee for Un-American Activities, which enjoys no glory whatever. In England, the King has more glory than the Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister has more power than the King. Many people prefer glory to power, but on the whole these people have less effect upon the course of events than those who prefer power to glory. When Bl��cher, in 1814, saw Napoleon’s palaces, he said, ?Wasn’t he a fool to have all this and to go running after Moscow.? Napoleon, who certainly was not destitute of vanity, preferred power when he had to choose. To Bl��cher, this choice seemed foolish. Power, like vanity, is insatiable. Nothing short of omnipotence could satisfy it completely. And as it is especially the vice of energetic men, the causal efficacy of love of power is out of all proportion to its frequency. It is, indeed, by far the strongest motive in the lives of important men.</p>
<p>Love of power is greatly increased by the experience of power, and this applies to petty power as well as to that of potentates. In the happy days before 1914, when well-to-do ladies could acquire a host of servants, their pleasure in exercising power over the domestics steadily increased with age. Similarly, in any autocratic regime, the holders of power become increasingly tyrannical with experience of the delights that power can afford. Since power over human beings is shown in making them do what they would rather not do, the man who is actuated by love of power is more apt to inflict pain than to permit pleasure. If you ask your boss for leave of absence from the office on some legitimate occasion, his love of power will derive more satisfaction from a refusal than from a consent. If you require a building permit, the petty official concerned will obviously get more pleasure from saying ?No? than from saying ?Yes?. It is this sort of thing which makes the love of power such a dangerous motive.</p>
<p>But it has other sides which are more desirable. The pursuit of knowledge is, I think, mainly actuated by love of power. And so are all advances in scientific technique. In politics, also, a reformer may have just as strong a love of power as a despot. It would be a complete mistake to decry love of power altogether as a motive. Whether you will be led by this motive to actions which are useful, or to actions which are pernicious, depends upon the social system, and upon your capacities. If your capacities are theoretical or technical, you will contribute to knowledge or technique, and, as a rule, your activity will be useful. If you are a politician you may be actuated by love of power, but as a rule this motive will join itself on to the desire to see some state of affairs realized which, for some reason, you prefer to the status quo. A great general may, like Alcibiades, be quite indifferent as to which side he fights on, but most generals have preferred to fight for their own country, and have, therefore, had other motives besides love of power. The politician may change sides so frequently as to find himself always in the majority, but most politicians have a preference for one party to the other, and subordinate their love of power to this preference. Love of power as nearly pure as possible is to be seen in various different types of men. One type is the soldier of fortune, of whom Napoleon is the supreme example. Napoleon had, I think, no ideological preference for France over Corsica, but if he had become Emperor of Corsica he would not have been so great a man as he became by pretending to be a Frenchman. Such men, however, are not quite pure examples, since they also derive immense satisfaction from vanity. The purest type is that of the eminence grise - the power behind the throne that never appears in public, and merely hugs itself with the secret thought: ?How little these puppets know who is pulling the strings.? Baron Holstein, who controlled the foreign policy of the German Empire from 1890 to 1906, illustrates this type to perfection. He lived in a slum; he never appeared in society; he avoided meeting the Emperor, except on one single occasion when the Emperor’s importunity could not be resisted; he refused all invitations to Court functions, on the ground that he possessed no court dress. He had acquired secrets which enabled him to blackmail the Chancellor and many of the Kaiser’s intimates. He used the power of blackmail, not to acquire wealth, or fame, or any other obvious advantage, but merely to compel the adoption of the foreign policy he preferred. In the East, similar characters were not very uncommon among eunuchs.</p>
<p>I come now to other motives which, though in a sense less fundamental than those we have been considering, are still of considerable importance. The first of these is love of excitement. Human beings show their superiority to the brutes by their capacity for boredom, though I have sometimes thought, in examining the apes at the zoo, that they, perhaps, have the rudiments of this tiresome emotion. However that may be, experience shows that escape from boredom is one of the really powerful desires of almost all human beings. When white men first effect contact with some unspoilt race of savages, they offer them all kinds of benefits, from the light of the gospel to pumpkin pie. These, however, much as we may regret it, most savages receive with indifference. What they really value among the gifts that we bring to them is intoxicating liquor which enables them, for the first time in their lives, to have the illusion for a few brief moments that it is better to be alive than dead. Red Indians, while they were still unaffected by white men, would smoke their pipes, not calmly as we do, but orgiastically, inhaling so deeply that they sank into a faint. And when excitement by means of nicotine failed, a patriotic orator would stir them up to  attack a neighbouring tribe, which would give them all the enjoyment that we (according to our temperament) derive from a horse race or a General Election. The pleasure of gambling consists almost entirely in excitement. Monsieur Huc describes Chinese traders at the Great Wall in winter, gambling until they have lost all their cash, then proceeding to lose all their merchandise, and at last gambling away their clothes and going out naked to die of cold. With civilized men, as with primitive Red Indian tribes, it is, I think, chiefly love of excitement which makes the populace applaud when war breaks out; the emotion is exactly the same as at a football match, although the results are sometimes somewhat more serious.</p>
<p>It is not altogether easy to decide what is the root cause of the love of excitement. I incline to think that our mental make-up is adapted to the stage when men lived by hunting. When a man spent a long day with very primitive weapons in stalking a deer with the hope of dinner, and when, at the end of the day, he dragged the carcass triumphantly to his cave, he sank down in contented weariness, while his wife dressed and cooked the meat. He was sleepy, and his bones ached, and the smell of cooking filled every nook and cranny of his consciousness. At last, after eating, he sank into deep sleep. In such a life there was neither time nor energy for boredom. But when he took to agriculture, and made his wife do all the heavy work in the fields, he had time to reflect upon the vanity of human life, to invent mythologies and systems of philosophy, and to dream of the life hereafter in which he would perpetually hunt the wild boar of Valhalla. Our mental make-up is suited to a life of very severe physical labor. I used, when I was younger, to take my holidays walking. I would cover twenty-five miles a day, and when the evening came I had no need of anything to keep me from boredom, since the delight of sitting amply sufficed. But modern life cannot be conducted on these physically strenuous principles. A great deal of work is sedentary, and most manual work exercises only a few specialized muscles. When crowds assemble in Trafalgar Square to cheer to the echo an announcement that the government has decided to have them killed, they would not do so if they had all walked twenty-five miles that day. This cure for bellicosity is, however, impracticable, and if the human race is to survive - a thing which is, perhaps, undesirable - other means must be found for securing an innocent outlet for the unused physical energy that produces love of excitement. This is a matter which has been too little considered, both by moralists and by social reformers. The social reformers are of the opinion that they have more serious things to consider. The moralists, on the other hand, are immensely impressed with the seriousness of all the permitted outlets of the love of excitement; the seriousness, however, in their minds, is that of Sin. Dance halls, cinemas, this age of jazz, are all, if we may believe our ears, gateways to Hell, and we should be better employed sitting at home contemplating our sins. I find myself unable to be in entire agreement with the grave men who utter these warnings. The devil has many forms, some designed to deceive the young, some designed to deceive the old and serious. If it is the devil that tempts the young to enjoy themselves, is it not, perhaps, the same personage that persuades the old to condemn their enjoyment? And is not condemnation perhaps merely a form of excitement appropriate to old age? And is it not, perhaps, a drug which - like opium - has to be taken in continually stronger doses to produce the desired effect? Is it not to be feared that, beginning with the wickedness of the cinema, we should be led step by step to condemn the opposite political party, dagoes, wops, Asiatics, and, in short, everybody except the fellow members of our club? And it is from just such condemnations, when widespread, that wars proceed. I have never heard of a war that proceeded from dance halls.</p>
<p>What is serious about excitement is that so many of its forms are destructive. It is destructive in those who cannot resist excess in alcohol or gambling. It is destructive when it takes the form of mob violence. And above all it is destructive when it leads to war. It is so deep a need that it will find harmful outlets of this kind unless innocent outlets are at hand. There are such innocent outlets at present in sport, and in politics so long as it is kept within constitutional bounds. But these are not sufficient, especially as the kind of politics that is most exciting is also the kind that does most harm. Civilized life has grown altogether too tame, and, if it is to be stable, it must provide harmless outlets for the impulses which our remote ancestors satisfied in hunting. In Australia, where people are few and rabbits are many, I watched a whole populace satisfying the primitive impulse in the primitive manner by the skillful slaughter of many thousands of rabbits. But in London or New York some other means must be found to gratify primitive impulse. I think every big town should contain artificial waterfalls that people could descend in very fragile canoes, and they should contain bathing pools full of mechanical sharks. Any person found advocating a preventive war should be condemned to two hours a day with these ingenious monsters. More seriously, pains should be taken to provide constructive outlets for the love of excitement. Nothing in the world is more exciting than a moment of sudden discovery or invention, and many more people are capable of experiencing such moments than is sometimes thought.</p>
<p>Interwoven with many other political motives are two closely related passions to which human beings are regrettably prone: I mean fear and hate. It is normal to hate what we fear, and it happens frequently, though not always, that we fear what we hate. I think it may be taken as the rule among primitive men, that they both fear and hate whatever is unfamiliar. They have their own herd, originally a very small one. And within one herd, all are friends, unless there is some special ground of enmity. Other  herds are potential or actual enemies; a single member of one of them who strays by accident will be killed. An alien herd as a whole will be avoided or fought according to circumstances. It is this primitive mechanism which still controls our instinctive reaction to foreign nations. The completely untravelled person will view all foreigners as the savage regards a member of another herd. But the man who has travelled, or who has studied international politics, will have discovered that, if his herd is to prosper, it must, to some degree, become amalgamated with other herds. If you are English and someone says to you, ?The French are your brothers?, your first instinctive feeling will be, ?Nonsense. They shrug their shoulders, and talk French. And I am even told that they eat frogs.? If he explains to you that we may have to fight the Russians, that, if so, it will be desirable to defend the line of the Rhine, and that, if the line of the Rhine is to be defended, the help of the French is essential, you will begin to see what he means when he says that the French are your brothers. But if some fellow-traveller were to go on to say that the Russians also are your brothers, he would be unable to persuade you, unless he could show that we are in danger from the Martians. We love those who hate our enemies, and if we had no enemies there would be very few people whom we should love.</p>
<p>All this, however, is only true so long as we are concerned solely with attitudes towards other human beings. You might regard the soil as your enemy because it yields reluctantly a niggardly subsistence. You might regard Mother Nature in general as your enemy, and envisage human life as a struggle to get the better of Mother Nature. If men viewed life in this way, cooperation of the whole human race would become easy. And men could easily be brought to view life in this way if schools, newspapers, and politicians devoted themselves to this end. But schools are out to teach patriotism; newspapers are out to stir up excitement; and politicians are out to get re-elected. None of the three, therefore, can do anything towards saving the human race from reciprocal suicide.</p>
<p>There are two ways of coping with fear: one is to diminish the external danger, and the other is to cultivate Stoic endurance. The latter can be reinforced, except where immediate action is necessary, by turning our thoughts away from the cause of fear. The conquest of fear is of very great importance. Fear is in itself degrading; it easily becomes an obsession; it produces hate of that which is feared, and it leads headlong to excesses of cruelty. Nothing has so beneficent an effect on human beings as security. If an international system could be established which would remove the fear of war, the improvement in everyday mentality of everyday people would be enormous and very rapid. Fear, at present, overshadows the world. The atom bomb and the bacterial bomb, wielded by the wicked communist or the wicked capitalist as the case may be, make Washington and the Kremlin tremble, and drive men further along the road toward the abyss. If matters are to improve, the first and essential step is to find a way of diminishing fear. The world at present is obsessed by the conflict of rival ideologies, and one of the apparent causes of conflict is the desire for the victory of our own ideology and the defeat of the other. I do not think that the fundamental motive here has much to do with ideologies. I think the ideologies are merely a way of grouping people, and that the passions involved are merely those which always arise between rival groups. There are, of course, various reasons for hating communists. First and foremost, we believe that they wish to take away our property. But so do burglars, and although we disapprove of burglars our attitude towards them is very different indeed from our attitude towards communists - chiefly because they do not inspire the same degree of fear. Secondly, we hate the communists because they are irreligious. But the Chinese have been irreligious since the eleventh century, and we only began to hate them when they turned out Chiang Kai-shek. Thirdly, we hate the communists because they do not believe in democracy, but we consider this no reason for hating Franco. Fourthly, we hate them because they do not allow liberty; this we feel so strongly that we have decided to imitate them. It is obvious that none of these is the real ground for our hatred. We hate them because we fear them and they threaten us. If the Russians still adhered to the Greek Orthodox religion, if they had instituted parliamentary government, and if they had a completely free press which daily vituperated us, then - provided they still had armed forces as powerful as they have now - we should still hate them if they gave us ground for thinking them hostile. There is, of course, the odium theologicum, and it can be a cause of enmity. But I think that this is an offshoot of herd feeling: the man who has a different theology feels strange, and whatever is strange must be dangerous. Ideologies, in fact, are one of the methods by which herds are created, and the psychology is much the same however the herd may have been generated.</p>
<p>You may have been feeling that I have allowed only for bad motives, or, at best, such as are ethically neutral. I am afraid they are, as a rule, more powerful than more altruistic motives, but I do not deny that altruistic motives exist, and may, on occasion, be effective. The agitation against slavery in England in the early nineteenth century was indubitably altruistic, and was thoroughly effective. Its altruism was proved by the fact that in 1833 British taxpayers paid many millions in compensation to Jamaican landowners for the liberation of their slaves, and also by the fact that at the Congress of Vienna the British Government was prepared to make important concessions with a view to inducing other nations to abandon the slave trade. This is an instance from the past, but present-day America has afforded instances equally remarkable. I will not, however, go into these, as I do not wish to become embarked in current controversies.</p>
<p>I do not think it can be questioned that sympathy is a genuine motive, and that some people at some times are made somewhat uncomfortable by the sufferings of some other people. It is sympathy that has produced the many humanitarian advances of the last hundred years. We are shocked when we hear stories ofthe ill-treatment of lunatics, and there are now quite a number of asylums in which they are not ill-treated. Prisoners in Western countries are not supposed to be tortured, and when they are, there is an outcry if the facts are discovered. We do not approve of treating orphans as they are treated in Oliver Twist. Protestant countries disapprove of cruelty to animals. In all these ways sympathy has been politically effective. If the fear of war were removed, its effectiveness would become much greater. Perhaps the best hope for the future of mankind is that ways will be found of increasing the scope and intensity of sympathy.</p>
<p>The time has come to sum up our discussion. Politics is concerned with herds rather than with individuals, and the passions which are important in politics are, therefore, those in which the various members of a given herd can feel alike. The broad instinctive mechanism upon which political edifices have to be built is one of cooperation within the herd and hostility towards other herds. The co-operation within the herd is never perfect. There are members who do not conform, who are, in the etymological sense, ?egregious?, that is to say, outside the flock. These members are those who have fallen below, or risen above, the ordinary level. They are: idiots, criminals, prophets, and discoverers. A wise herd will learn to tolerate the eccentricity of those who rise above the average, and to treat with a minimum of ferocity those who fall below it.</p>
<p>As regards relations to other herds, modern technique has produced a conflict between self-interest and instinct. In old days, when two tribes went to war, one of them exterminated the other, and annexed its territory. From the point of view of the victor, the whole operation was thoroughly satisfactory. The killing was not at all expensive, and the excitement was agreeable. It is not to be wondered at that, in such circumstances, war persisted. Unfortunately, we still have the emotions appropriate to such primitive warfare, while the actual operations of war have changed completely. Killing an enemy in a modern war is a very expensive operation. If you consider how many Germans were killed in the late war, and how much the victors are paying in income tax, you can, by a sum in long division, discover the cost of a dead German, and you will find it considerable. In the East, it is true, the enemies of the Germans have secured the ancient advantages of turning out the defeated population and occupying their lands. The Western victors, however, have secured no such advantages. It is obvious that modern war is not good business from a financial point of view. Although we won both the world wars, we should now be much richer if they had not occured. If men were actuated by self-interest, which they are not - except in the case of a few saints - the whole human race would cooperate. There would be no more wars, no more armies, no more navies, no more atom bombs. There would not be armies of propagandists employed in poisoning the minds of Nation A against Nation B, and reciprocally of Nation B against Nation A. There would not be armies of officials at frontiers to prevent the entry of foreign books and foreign ideas, however excellent in themselves. There would not be customs barriers to ensure the existence of many small enterprises where one big enterprise would be more economic. All this would happen very quickly if men desired their own happiness as ardently as they desired the misery of their neighbours. But, you will tell me, what is the use of these utopian dreams ? Moralists will see to it that we do not become wholly selfish, and until we do the millenium will be impossible.</p>
<p>I do not wish to seem to end upon a note of cynicism. I do not deny that there are better things than selfishness, and that some people achieve these things. I maintain, however, on the one hand, that there are few occasions upon which large bodies of men, such as politics is concerned with, can rise above selfishness, while, on the other hand, there are a very great many circumstances in which populations will fall below selfishness, if selfishness is interpreted as enlightened self-interest.</p>
<p>And among those occasions on which people fall below self-interest are most of the occasions on which they are convinced that they are acting from idealistic motives. Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power. When you see large masses of men swayed by what appear to be noble motives, it is as well to look below the surface and ask yourself what it is that makes these motives effective. It is partly because it is so easy to be taken in by a facade of nobility that a psychological inquiry, such as I have been attempting, is worth making. I would say, in conclusion, that if what I have said is right, the main thing needed to make the world happy is intelligence. And this, after all, is an optimistic conclusion, because intelligence is a thing that can be fostered by known methods of education.</p>

        <p>十年间，这篇文章始终能让我热血沸腾。<br>文中我认为多余的部分用删除线划掉了。</p>
<p>《胯下奇辱 》  朱鸿<br>　　士可杀而不可辱。<br><del>我一向偏爱这个句子，它组合得很是完整，但它却又不呆板，也不生硬。在严谨之中，它还有足够的润滑与疏朗。这个句子是有美感的，而且由于它的简洁和精辟，早就发展为一个成语了。不过它显然不是一般的成语，它的劝戒、警告，它的使用率之高、知名度之大，都超出了成语的范畴而升华为一个格言了。</del><br>　　<del>它实际上已经是中国知识分子的一个精神准则、一个忍耐的底线。在关键的时候，它还是中国知识分子进行动员的口号。</del><br>　　<del>如果带着抑扬顿挫一字一字地吟咏它，那么我总会感到，从丹田涌动的凛然之气，能把我劳损的脊梁撑得很直。我经常吟咏它，默默地吟咏。我以为它的意义是明白的，但它所蕴藏的深刻而深长的意义，却似乎仍需要继续挖掘。</del><br>　　它源于孔子之意，是孔子向鲁哀公释儒之际提出的。孔子认为，也许儒是可杀的，然而儒却是不可辱的，可杀而不可辱，既是官方对儒应该掌握的尺度，又是儒应该具备的品质。<br>　　士可杀而不可辱，则是王鏊在孔子逝世两千年之后所说的话。王鏊在明政府工作，当然属于统治阶级，不过良心未殁。有一天，他看见太监刘瑾对一位有违法行为的大臣辱而杀之，愤慨不已，极力阻止，并大声疾呼：士可杀，不可辱。<br>　　在明政府办公之地，以直率的办法，拦挡皇帝的亲信对一个嫌疑犯进行迫害，确实需要非常的胆识。<br>　　在我看起来，王鏊的观点与孔子的观点是一脉相承的。他显然沿袭了孔子的思想，不过也有所发展。他把在审讯和行刑之际应该注意其尊严的人，从为贵族之家相礼的一批有专业技术的人，扩而大之为所有的知识分子，甚至扩而大之为所有的成年男性。<br>　　王鏊没有把女性包括在应该注意其尊严的范畴之中，是他的局限，当然也是时代的局限，因为在他所处的时代，女性都是卑贱的，缺乏为人资格的。<br>　　现在变化了，现在的女性与男性已经有了平等的权利，据此我以为，现在应该把士可杀而不可辱，提升为人可杀而不可辱。实际上我想强调的是，任何玷污人、使人蒙羞的做法都是不能接受的。也许社会在明天还将发展为人不可杀也不可辱，不过现在能做到人可杀而不可辱，也是一个进步了。<br>　　顺便指出，格言是成语的一种，并为人们长期使用，所以在文章之中出现的格言是不打引号的。打引号显得啰嗦，还影响阅读快感。不知道其他人怎样，反正我不喜欢给格言打引号。<br>　　为什么侮辱一个人比杀死一个人还严重，这并非不是一个问题。我以为，人之所以确立，不仅仅因为人是一个高级动物，不仅仅因为人会劳动，充满智慧。人之所以确立，主要是人在肉体之上还有灵魂，它是人在文明过程中逐步形成的，其核心是尊严。生命固然是宝贵的，不过生命如果丧失了尊严，那么它便削弱了自己的价值。<br>　　我敬仰这样一种人，他千方百计，甚至不惜牺牲生命也要维护自己的信仰，维护自己的自由，维护自己的爱。这样的人不仅仅是活着，重要的是他尊严地活着。<br>　　春秋战国时代一个名为晏子的人，受齐王派遣，走进了楚王的宫殿。楚王微笑着，示意晏子坐下，随之有侍女沏上了茶。<br>　　晏子觉得楚王还是友好的，但实际上这却是一个表面现象。晏子马上就会看到一幕使他蒙羞的把戏，导演当然是楚王。<br>　　会晤刚刚开始，楚国司法机构一个官员便押上一个行窃的人，此官员当着晏子的面，指控行窃的是齐国人，随之楚王沉着脸，阴险地问晏子：齐国人一向就喜欢行窃吗?晏子立即明白楚王的险恶用意，遂机智地回答：人在齐国并不行窃，事实是，到了楚国才行窃的，这仿佛在淮南生为橘子而在淮北便生为枳子一样。<br>　　晏子巧妙地躲过了泼向他和齐国人的脏水，而且他所表现的一种风度，甚至使玩弄花招的楚王也暗中钦佩。关键是，这个遥远时代的使者，以自己的行动向人类昭示了尊严是一个存在，维护尊严是必须的。<br>　　但悲哀的是，韩信却未能逃脱胯下奇辱。他似乎注定要碰到一个摧毁他的屠夫，以使他永远带着屈服的隐痛。<br>　　我以为，那应该是一个阳光灿烂的日子，淮阴的街上游走着一些闲散的人。这时候年轻的韩信过来了，他佩着剑，迈着方正的脚步，眉眼之间透出胸怀大志之情。<br>　　在淮阴，很多人都知道韩信家境贫困，偶尔还需要寄食。然而他的做派却特别得很，他常常给人一种傲慢的印象，仿佛他马上就会离开这里，成事而去。<br>　　如果韩信的傲慢不是一种挑衅，不是故意在伤害谁，那么就让他傲慢吧，让他摆他的姿态吧，因为这是他的个性，也是他的权利。虽然道理是这样，但实际情况却并不这样简单。他所流露的神情使周围的人感到了自己的渺小和低俗，并使周围的人对他产生了嫉妒。嫉妒迅速发酵为恼怒和怨恨，并哺育了一个打击韩信的阴谋。不过韩信并不知道，他还蒙在鼓里。<br>　　韩信静静地在街上走着，不招谁，不惹谁，似乎是安全的，岂不知他一点也不安全。尽管他没有妨碍谁，可一个屠夫却吆喝着过去妨碍他了。韩信看到屠夫叉开两腿拦住他，大声奚落他身材高大，喜欢兵器，像是一个英雄，实际上只是一个懦夫。街上的人对屠夫的恶举，不但没有仗义劝阻，反而一波一波地起哄着，有的还在极力地纵容屠夫。屠夫遂得寸进尺，向韩信提出了一个两难的方案让其选择：要么用剑击倒他当英雄，要么从他胯下爬过做懦夫。<br>　　屠夫显然是欺人太甚了。韩信感到愤怒的烈焰迅速燃烧着他的心。他咬着牙，瞪着眼睛，手握紧成拳，似乎扬眉之间剑就出鞘了。然而在最后的一瞬，他却又政变了主意。他决定忍，怎么都要忍。于是韩信就蹲下身子，双手按地，把头伸进屠夫的胯下，接着匍匐而行，一寸一寸地爬过了一个丑陋的空洞。<br>　　韩信品味似地慢慢站起来，他仿佛是到了一个陌生的地方。他听见街上的笑声铺天盖地，连绵起伏。<br>　　笑声像冬天的雪一样热闹，像秋天的鸡毛一样杂乱。他在笑声之中毅然而去。他把笑声留在了家乡。<br>　　多年之后，韩信为汉帝国打下了大片江山，刘邦不得不封他做楚王。他有声有势，荣归故里。他牵挂着屠夫，似乎一直都牵挂着侮辱他的屠夫，因为他居然让人找到那个屠夫，并特别地任命屠夫为中尉。<br>　　韩信还对自己过去之所以接受胯下奇耻作了解。他认为，他是能够杀死屠夫的，不过杀死他缺乏名目，就忍了。他忍了，才有今天。<br>　　韩信的妙计是，给屠夫以友谊和职位。韩信以缩短他与屠夫距离的方式淡化故事，从而分散了家乡之人对他创伤的注意。<br>　　他让屠夫在自己麾下工作，实际上已经是在报复夫了，但表面上却显示了他的宽容。把事情能做成这样的也只有韩信了。<br>　　韩信对自己为什么会接受胯下奇耻的解释，尽管言近旨远，但我却是姑妄听之，不十分相信。不过他的解释倒是打开丁一条通向其灵魂的道路，所以应该注意他的解释。<br>　　在我看起来，韩信是这样安排他的灵魂的。他认为，功利是衡量人的价值的终极标准，为了功利，人是可以接受侮辱的。他还认为，巨大的功利一定会抵消追求功利过程所曾经接受的侮辱。<br>　　如果我的分析是对的，那么韩信的灵魂就很是可怕。我以为他的灵魂有一种流氓气息。<br>　　一些学者总是为韩信鸣不平，而且中国人一向喜欢同情失败之徒。他们觉得刘邦及其吕皇后是不道德的，坐了江山便要除掉韩信。<br>　　刘邦之流固然是不道德的，当然，这一类人何止能以不道德而为之定位。尽管如此，中国人也不能由于刘邦之流迫害了韩信就确认韩信是贤良的。逻辑似乎并不是这样简单的。也许刘邦之流对韩信的斗争，是一群大流氓对一个小流氓的斗争。实际上我就是这样判断的，我难道错了吗?<br>　　依刘邦之流的哲学，刘邦除掉韩信，并没有什么奇怪的，因为他是皇帝，他必须巩固自己的权力，这决定了他会瞪大眼睛，留意着企图谋反的人。他对对汉帝国的建立有功勋的人，不但时时警惕，而且处处怀疑。这是刘邦的秉性，也是所有集权统治权力中心固有的风景。<br>　　我以为，韩信之死，关键在于韩信，在于他的谋反活动给刘邦之流提供了除掉他的把柄。<br>　　根据司马迁的记录，事情的经过是这样的：韩信乘刘邦率兵不在长安之机，向巨鹿郡首授以机宜，要其在巨鹿起兵，他将在长安内应。这是大事，当然也是秘密，可惜不知道是怎么搞的，关于联合起兵的消息很快就泄露了。如果韩信能及时获悉情况的变化，那么韩信还是会有弥补之术的。问题是他并不清楚情况发生了变化，当然也不清楚吕皇后已经策划了一个逮捕他的方案。他仍在长安秘密准备着。有一天，萧何召韩信到未央宫去开会，以祝贺刘邦平定叛乱的胜利。韩信觉得有诈，不想去，但他却不能不去，于是他就毛毛地去了。诚如其所料，刚刚步入未央宫，卫兵便抓了他，随之他的头便落地了。<br>　　这件事情发生在公元前196年的秋天，那些日子，黄叶飘飞，大雁哀鸣，长安很有一点悲凉的气氛。<br>　　成也萧何，是有道理的，不过败也萧何就未必有道理了。韩信根据他的贡献，觉得汉政府应该给他很大的荣誉和权力，可结果，他却从独有地盘的楚王降为一个淮阴侯了。韩信不服，不满，耿耿于怀，并终于导致了他的谋反活动。<br>　　韩信是有谋反之心的。不过如果刘邦愿意，那么刘邦将可以化解其阴谋，可惜刘邦不但没有安抚韩信，反而提高了警惕，加深了怀疑，遂使韩信的谋反之心变成了谋反的行动。<br>　　韩信是一个有军事天才的人，在他的戎马生涯之中，到处飘扬着胜利的旗帜。进攻魏国，他佯装要划船渡河，但他转身却命令士兵浮水登岸。为防行动暴露，他竟奇异地让士兵抱着木瓮作掩饰。消灭赵国，他则作背水一战。燕国弱小，他便劝降之。齐国强大，而且有楚国支援，他遂集中力量，各个击破。垓下之战，为决定项羽与刘邦的命运之战，由于韩信的作用，项羽才自刎于垓下的。但这样一个军事天才却并没有保证自己能够善终，显然权力的斗争是复杂于军事斗争的。<br>　　韩信是跟随项梁开始革命的，项梁失败之后，顺延于项羽麾下，做保卫工作。他曾经热情地向项羽献计献策，但项羽却反应冷淡，不以为然。韩信碰壁，很是沮丧，遂产生了跳槽的念头。在刘邦当汉王人蜀之际，他离开项羽，加入到了刘邦的队伍之中以图发展。不过在刘邦麾下，他还是默默无闻。依韩信的所想，他投奔刘邦，当然是希望受到其重用的，可刘邦却目空韩信，让他做接待工作，之后管理粮饷。韩信觉得前途黯淡，便起了去意。<br>　　在一个月明星稀的晚上，韩信躲开放哨的士兵，穿过一片树林，沿着褒斜栈道，向长安运动。萧何是一直关注韩信的，那天晚上，他发现韩信跑了，竟不经请示而追赶之。他找到韩信，反复劝勉，总算把韩信拖了回来。<br>　　萧何是刘邦的谋臣，善于观察，很清楚韩信将大有作为。于是他就尽力举荐韩信，还设法要刘邦封其为将军。到这时候，韩信才有了发挥军事天才的机会。<br>　　我是韩信先生的晚辈，我只能从背后看韩信。从背后看韩信的优势是，可以清楚地发现他在路上留下的足迹。<br>　　我思考的是，韩信再三选择主子到底是为了什么?他是否有一个目标?晚辈要擦亮眼睛，并学习老吏断狱一般的审视，大约才能发现韩信是有一个目标的，这便是追求功利。<br>　　追求功利并非不高尚，而且谁都在追求功利，我也是在追求功利的。不过我觉得，怀着投机之念，依追求功利的快慢和大小而转换立场的人，将是危险的。我以为他们有反骨，反骨不一定长在头上，但它却一定长在心里。<br>　　刘邦与项羽之争，实际土是推翻秦政府之后而在大陆出现的一场权力之争。秦政府的压迫和剥削，使中国人是可忍也，孰不可忍也。这时候，刘邦和项羽站出来率农民起义军推翻秦始皇的集权统治，当然有巨大的进步意义。不过在秦政府灭亡之后，他们为掌握权力，为当皇帝，动之以武，并不经商量就把中国人拖进他们发动的兵乱之中，则显出了他们的虚伪和狭隘，甚至暴露了他们所潜藏的注定会反动的品质。<br>　　遗憾的是，像刘邦和项羽这种推翻一个集权统治，之后再建立一个集权统治，接着再推翻，再建立，这种形式在中国竟反复出现，成了规律。我以为，这是中国的悲哀。诗人曾经长叹，中华民族是一个灾难深重的民族，大约就包含着中国具有这种呈循环状的历史命运。<br>　　刘邦与项羽之争，此起彼伏，一战就是几年。有一阵，项羽把刘邦困在了荥阳，刘邦为突围则把项羽紧紧牵制着。你想吃掉我，我也想吃掉你，不过事实是，你无法吃掉我，我也无法吃掉你，就那么相持着。<br>　　当时，韩信独辟战区，有自己的管界，而且实力雄厚。如果他与刘邦联合，那么项羽必败，如果他与项羽联合，那么刘邦必败。天下好事者都知道韩信是一个重要砝码，便纷纷游说之，希望韩信有所行动。一个著名的辩士蒯通，甚至绞尽脑汁，以相面的角度分析韩信应该在关键之际发挥自己的作用以改变中国的未来。他还明确建议韩信自封为王，从而把刘邦和项羽从胶着状态中解脱出来，并开创他们三个人鼎足而立的局面。辩士晓之以理，动之以情，使韩信很是犹豫。但仔细斟酌之后，韩信却还是拒绝了辩士的建议，其原因是，刘邦对他是有恩惠的。韩信说：“汉王遇我甚厚，载我以其车，衣我以其衣，食我以其食。”<br>　　钟离昧曾经在项羽麾下工作，项羽自刎之后，投靠了韩信，因为他与韩信素有交情，关系密切，而且他觉得韩信是足以投靠的。但刘邦却嫌恶钟离昧，并扬言要逮捕他。韩信知道刘邦的所想之后，竟打算杀死钟离昧而把其首级献给刘邦。<br>　　辩士蒯通要韩信自封为王，韩信没有，似乎显示了韩信是有忠诚的品质的，其实非也。韩信并不是没有背叛刘邦之心。他之所以没有背叛，无非是刘邦给他的待遇和享受还使他满意而已。韩信在一个关键之际不背叛刘邦与在另一个关键之际抛弃钟离昧，其动机是一致的，都是为了自己。在我看起来，韩信有所选择的忠诚，或在表面上的忠诚，掩盖了他内在的奸险，甚至掩盖了他的不道和不义。<br>　　在韩信打算向钟离昧下手的时候，钟离昧自刎了。动刀之前，钟离昧对韩信的结果作了预言，他认为将来刘邦一定要收拾他。钟离昧还谴责了韩信，其语气是鄙夷的、轻蔑的，他说：“公非长者!”<br>　　韩信的胯下之举，一直是很有市场的故事。中国人把这个故事绘以为图，演以为戏，拍摄为电影和电视。我不知道韩信的故事受到广泛宣扬是为之增光还是为之丢脸，也不知道韩信的故事久远流布是中国文化的积极成分还是消极成分，它是起美好作用还是起恶劣作用。总之是，韩信依然活着，而且他的胯下之举竟有了生存哲学的意义。它的启示似乎是：瞧!这个人，他为了达到自己的目的而接受了一般人难以接受的侮辱。<br>　　在中国，韩信显然是一个典范，一个能屈能伸的典范，用以后的业绩洗刷了以前的奇辱的典范。韩信所接受的侮辱，似乎成了他实现其目的的一个铺垫、一个陪衬，甚至是一个升华的动力。<br>　　然而，当世故老人皱着眉头大讲高讲韩信故事的时候，韩信却在地下哭泣。实际上韩信所受到的精神创伤一直在隐隐作痛，如果风寒和雨淋，那么其隐痛便变成了明显的刺痛和剧痛。这是世故老人所不知道的，他们当然也不知道韩信的哭泣。<br>　　尽管韩信永恒地幽禁在黄土之中了，但他却固执地关注着黄土之外的世界。在那黑暗和潮湿的地下，他以绝顶聪明反省自己的一生。<br>　　经过两千年之久的琢磨，他发现中国文化是一个腐蚀和摧残个性的场。在这里，任何突出的人都将可能受到打击。打击的铁拳是密集的、持续的，是多方位和多角度的，既来自官方，又来自民间。铁拳把一波一波优秀的人都砸扁了，并使其他人产生了对打击的恐惧。于是中国人就条件反射似的变幻自己活着的状态，而且总是病态地回避和躲闪，并夹着自己的尾巴。他们不得不呈一个四平八稳状。唯有少数人仍保持着一个人固有的血气，并在沉寂之中呐喊。<br>　　我以为，中国人的生存哲学是驳杂的，仿佛一锅以甜克苦、以酸制咸，甚至以毒攻毒的汤药。那些指导人行为的观点浩瀚若汪洋大海，但它们却自相矛盾。<br>　　在我看来，中国人所运用的种种退守的信条，主要源于老子。老子何以总结了令人心寒和悚然的经验，永远是一个谜。不过事实是，中国人多少接受了他的奉劝，逆来顺受地活着。<br>　　我想，之所以韩信能够作为一个典范，大约是因为韩信的胯下之举符合老子的观点吧。实际上他以后的飞黄腾达与死于刘邦之手，也为老子的观点作了见证。<br>　　韩信遭遇屠夫侮辱的原因是微妙的，我想沿着我的思路核对一下我曾经所作的分析。他出身低贱，依他的家庭背景和社会地位，他属于街上的人，似乎应该混迹于街上，甚至应该是屠夫的朋友。如果这样，那么街上的人，包括粗鲁的屠夫，将不会跟他发生冲突，反而还会跟他勾肩搭背，亲密相处。但韩信却有意疏离街上的人，因为他要出人头地。他总是把自己想象为一个将军，喜欢佩着剑走来走去。母亲逝世了，虽然他没有钱，但他却还坚持把母亲葬在一个高坡以留下一个祭祀母亲的地方。韩信所流露出来的一种超拔之感显然使街上的人恼火，因为街上的人觉得韩信向往的是另外一种生活，对他们有一点鄙夷。他们甚至认为韩信远走高飞的抱负，就是对他们的摆脱和抛弃。于是他们就讽刺他，挫损他，以致冲出来一个屠夫侮辱他，其目的是使韩信呆在街上，呆在他们之中。<br>　　大约半个世纪之前，一群农民报复一个小伙对一个姑娘的非礼，就抓住他，让他弯腰低头，下跪，并游斗他。在用种种方法惩罚了这个小伙之后，仍不解恨，便想新的惩罚的方法。他们从猴子经常做的一些猥亵的动作得到启示，遂狰狞地脱去小伙的裤子，捆绑了他的四肢，之后将他和猴子关在一间房屋，以使猴子抚弄他的生殖器。结果呢，结果是把他折磨得气息奄奄，几乎丧命。<br>　　谁能相信这样的侮辱之举是人的所为，谁能相信人竟野蛮到这样的程度。我必须强调，它不是虚构的故事，它就发生在一个有名有姓的地方，而且我实在不愿意指出它就发生在我的家乡。<br>　　这是一个年迈的教师告诉我的故事。当时在再三怀疑它是否真实之后，我久久忧郁。我看到了人性的黑暗，我为之悄悄地哭了。<br>　　侮辱一个人，就是用极端手段捣毁一个人的尊严，以释放自己的怨恨，从而获取一种邪恶的快感。侮辱一个人，似乎出于嫉妒，又不完全出于嫉妒，似乎出于征服，又不完全出于征服。<br>　　也许一个人遭遇侮辱，并不是自己造成的，不过在自己身上很可能多少存在着一种侮辱他人的激发素。侮辱他人的激发素往往表现为一个人所有的优越感：或出身高贵，或才华炫耀，或气度轩昂，或容貌出众，而且总是有意无意地置他人于卑下之中，拒他人于千里之外，使他人自惭形秽。一个人所有的优越感，会使他人藏在暗中的嫉妒之心和征服之欲发展为侮辱的动力，并通过侮辱有优越感的人而达到自己的心理平衡。这是中国文化中的一个毒素，它导致的结果是，劣胜而优汰。<br>　　人对人的侮辱，有时候会弥漫为民族对民族的侮辱，也会传染为阶级对阶级的侮辱，甚至还引发性别之间的侮辱。<br>　　性别之间的侮辱，主要表现为男性对女性的侮辱，手法是在公众场合脱去女性的衣服，从而伤害之。以这样的办法侮辱女性，在世界很多地方都有，而且过去有，现在还有，是扎根在人类的传统之中的。不过随着人类文明的扩大，随着女性地位的提升，企图侮辱女性的男性不得不收敛自己，约束自己，因为侮辱女性不但无理无能，而且野蛮。<br>　　阶级对阶级的侮辱，主要发生在20世纪一段时期，发生在无产阶级对地主阶级和资产阶级的革命之后。办法是，除了对倒霉的统治阶级作咒骂之外，我所知道的还有剃光头，戴高帽，以唾沫溅脸。<br>　　民族对民族的侮辱，似乎总是发生在民族矛盾激烈而容易使用暴力的地方。一般是在失去理性的情况之下，抹黑信仰，捣毁教堂，甚至男性对女性作集体强奸。非常遗憾，直到今天这样的事件在地球的某些地方仍然发生着。<br>　　一个人是否会受到侮辱，并不是自己可以决定的，但如何对待侮辱，却由自己决定。当然，一个人应该尽量智慧地避免受侮辱，这一点非常重要。可有的时候，一个人却是无法躲过侮辱的，这便使自己有了一次考验自己的机会：要么接受侮辱，从而得利或残存，要么拒绝侮辱，从而招祸或遇难，这一切将完全由自己决定。<br>　　谁都有在两极之间作出自己选择的权利，而且选择的标准是由自己掌握的。制约选择的主要因素是一个人将如何对待尊严。<br>　　著名作家老舍先生在徘徊很久之后，自沉于太平湖。这是1966年8月25日发生的事情。两天之前。他遭遇了难以接受的咒骂和殴打，他不知道这是为什么。他反复考虑，上下求索，百思不得其解。他感到世界的肮脏。他显然已经很厌恶它了，遂决定离开它。<br>　　在我看起来，老舍先生选择了死，实际上就是选择了尊严。当他感到这个世界不能让人尊严地活着的时候，他认为这样的世界就不值得留恋了，就可以放弃。也许老舍先生的所想并不这样简单，也许他自沉太平湖的行为，就是他的唯一注释。<br>　　韩信之墓在渭河北岸，很多人都看过它。人说：韩信之墓周围的土地不长五谷，颜色是红的，是血染的土地，土地硬得仿佛石头一般。人说：土地硬得仿佛石头一般，是苍天的抗议，是人类不道不义的印痕。<br>　　我是喜欢古迹的，西安方圆几百公里内外的古迹我几乎都看过了。我以为，走近那些古迹，用手触摸它们，有一种走近祖先的感觉，甚至有一种拥抱祖先的感觉。然而我却一直没有看过韩信之墓，我对它没有兴趣。<br><del>士可杀而不可辱。</del><br>(完)</p>
